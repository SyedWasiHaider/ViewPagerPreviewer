# ViewPagerPreviewer
Shows a preview of offscreen fragments in a viewpager. This is highly experimental. Use at your own risk. Also, I encourage you to contribute with pull requests.

#Example

#Issues

-Initially nothing is visible.
-Increasing the number of offscreen pages will slow it down
-Many more that I haven't thought of yet.
