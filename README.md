# ViewPagerPreviewer
Shows a preview of offscreen fragments in a viewpager. This is highly experimental. Use at your own risk. Also, I encourage you to contribute with pull requests.

#Issues

* Need someone to help me with this painful gradle stuff to publish to maven or jcenter.
* Increasing the number of offscreen pages will slow it down
* Many more that I haven't thought of yet.
